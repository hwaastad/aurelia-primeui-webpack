# aurelia-primeui-webpack

Demo Project for primefaces components in aurelia using webpack

I will incorporate similar integration being used by primefaces in their primeng project.
Goal is to build a primeui library when primeng is released.

In addition aurelia samples for amcharts are also added

    npm install
    typings install


    npm run dev
